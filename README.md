# Lab Training: Control of a redundant simulated robotic arm by using a ROS interface
During this lab training, the control of a 7 DOF robotic manipulator (Kuka iiwa) was investigated using an interface based on ROS and Python. This was implemented and tested with the simulator (Gazebo) integrated into the Neurorobotics Platform, a framework for simulating neurorobotics experiments.
